# Contentstack Marketplace SDK Using Java

The **Marketplace** class provides a software development kit (SDK) to interact with the Contentstack Marketplace API. It facilitates the management of apps, authorizations, and installations within your Contentstack organization.

## Prerequisites

Before using the **Marketplace** SDK, ensure the following:

1. Java JDK 1.8 or above should be installed on your machine.
2. You have a valid Contentstack account with access to the Contentstack Marketplace.
3. You have obtained the necessary credentials like **organization UID** and **authtoken**, to interact with the Marketplace API.

## Installation

To use the Marketplace SDK in your Java project, follow these steps:

1. Download the contentstack-java SDK and its dependencies from the Contentstack Maven repository. Add the following dependencies to your project's pom.xml file:

```xml  
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.contentstack.sdk/marketplace -->  
<dependencies>  
 <dependency> <groupId>com.contentstack.sdk</groupId> 
     <artifactId>marketplace</artifactId> 
     <version>x.x.x</version> <!-- Replace 'x.x.x' with the latest version available --> 
 </dependency>
</dependencies>  


```  

2. Save the pom.xml file.

3. Ensure you have internet connectivity to download the SDK and its dependencies from the central Maven repository.

## How to Use

1. Initialize the Marketplace class with your organization UID:

```java  
import com.contentstack.sdk.marketplace.Marketplace;
Marketplace marketplace = new Marketplace  
        .Builder(TestClient.ORGANIZATION_UID)  // Required
        .host(HOST)  // Optional
        .authtoken("test")  // Optional
        .login("test@email.com", "*********")  // Optional
        .region(Region.AZURE_EU)  // Optional
        .build();  
```  

2. Use the various methods available in the Marketplace class to interact with the Marketplace API:

### Retrieve an instance of the App class:
Get an instance of the App class
```java  
import com.contentstack.sdk.marketplace.apps.App; 
App app = marketplace.app();  
// Alternatively, you can pass the app UID to retrieve a specific app   
App specificApp = marketplace.app("APP_UID");  
```  

### Retrieve an instance of the Auth class:

```java
import com.contentstack.sdk.marketplace.auths.Auth;  
// Get an instance of the Auth class  
Auth auth = marketplace.authorizations();  
```  

### Retrieve an instance of the Installation class:
Get an instance of the Installation class
```java
import com.contentstack.sdk.marketplace.installations.Installation; 
Installation installation = marketplace.installation();  
OR 
Installation specificInstallation = marketplace.installation("INSTALLATION_ID");  
```  

### Create an instance of the AppRequest class:
Get an instance of the AppRequest class
```java
import com.contentstack.sdk.marketplace.request.AppRequest;  
AppRequest appRequest = marketplace.request();  
```
